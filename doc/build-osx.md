## Notes

* See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Supermoon QT, the
graphical user interface.

* All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

## Prerequisites

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. 
You can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com
