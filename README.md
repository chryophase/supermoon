SUPERMOON is a Proof of Stake (PoS) based cryptocurrency, which has a unique approach to PoS, which links APR% Rewards to phases of moon in real time, changing constantly. Consisten events are New Moon, 

Supermoon gives bonuses for real time Stellar events such as Solar and Lunar Eclipses, Astroid showers, Annual periodic events such the Equinox, Planteray events and of course, the rare Supermoon and New Supermoons.  

Astronomy Calendar of Celestial Events are tracked in full for Calendar Year 2018, and Supermoon reacts to these calculated events by the second for the start of any event, measured in UTC time (Coordinated Universal Time) which is the the 24-hour time standard kept using highly precise atomic clocks combined with the Earth's rotation.

If any of these events occur at the same time, then the APR% rewards for each event stacks.

Supermoon Developers have also coded fixes to stop other classic PoS exploits such as wallet locking, which uses wallet locking to gain coinweight, and then unlock wallets to gain past coinweight rewards at the highest rate.
