SUPERMOON is a Proof of Stake (PoS) based cryptocurrency, which has a unique approach to PoS, which rewards variable APR% linked to phases of the Moon in real time. 

Consistently tracked events are: New Moon, Half Moon and Full Moon; each cycle rewards an APR% based per phase of a lunar 'week'
New Moon stake each reward 100% APR 
Half Moon stake each reward 200% APR 
Full Moon stake each reward 500% APR

SUPERMOON reacts with bonus APR% for various Stellar events such as: Asteroid shower peaks and Planetary events, annual periodic events such the Equinox and Solstices. The highest rewards are gained via Solar & Lunar Eclipses, Blue Moons and of course, the rare Supermoon & New Supermoon
Bonus reward Stellar Events for shown periods:
* Meteor Showers : +200% APR (Peak 24-48 Hours of Event)
* Equinox or Solstice : +200% APR (24 Hours of Event)
* Planet 'Transits' the sun : +200% APR (timed per second of event)
* Monthly (or Seasonal) Blue Moon : +300% APR (24 Hours of Event)
* Solar or Lunar Eclipse : +300% APR (timed per second of event)
* SUPERMOON (or New Supermoon) : +400% APR (24 Hours of occurrence)

For dual or triple stellar bonus events occurring simultaneously , SUPERMOON will stack the rewards from each and also give a bonus +100% APR for Dual or +200% APR for Triple, all timed to the second of the overlap

See the Calendar page for key Astronomy Calendars Stellar / Celestial events for the 2018 year onward 

SUPERMOON reacts to the published calculated events by the second for the start of any event and the 24-hour Universal Standard Time (UTC) published time is measured via precise atomic clocks
