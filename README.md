SUPERMOON is a Proof of Stake (PoS) based cryptocurrency, which has a unique approach to PoS, which links APR% Rewards to phases of moon in real time, changing constantly.  

Supermoon gives bonuses for real time Stellar events such as Eclipses, Astroid showers, Annual periodic events such and of course, the rare Supermoon and New Supermoons.

If any of these events occur at the same time, then the APR% stacks....

Supermoon Developers have also coded fixes to stop other classic PoS exploits such as wallet locking, which uses wallet locking to gain coinweight, and then unlock wallets to gain past coinweight rewards at the highest rate.
